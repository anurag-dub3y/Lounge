# Lounge

Lounge is a full-stack MERN web app that allows a user to create and view posts. It uses JWT authentication to log in a user. 
Once a user is logged in, they can view posts created by other users in the home page. The post models are defined in a way that each post is tagged with a genre, which also allows the users to look for posts with a specific tag.
There is also an added functionality of regenerating forgotten passwords with the help of the Nodemailer package.
In the future, a post will also be able to have image(s) along with the main content.

This project will soon be deployed with Heroku.
